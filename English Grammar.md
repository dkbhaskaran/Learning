# English grammar

## ***Phrases, clauses, sentances***
- phrase is a collection of words without a subject verb combination. 
	- *car* is a noun 
	- *The car* is a noun phrase.
	- *The expensive car* is a noun phrase. 
- Clause : Subject + Verb.
	- Dependent clause : are not meaningful. 
		*Because the car broke down*
	- Independent clause : are meaningful by themselves. 
		*The car broke down*
		*I was late*
- Sentance signified by a full stop.
	- *The car has broke down.*

Consider the example 

John, who is rich, is my neighbor. Now the second "is" is the verb of john as the sentance "John is my neighbor." is a well formed sentance. The first "is" the verb for who and who refers to John. *who is rich* is dependent clause. The other words are who, whom, that, which etc.

## ***Subject should agree with verb. e.g***
- Hi *is* rich. (Subject is "he")
- John and Jack *are* rich. (Subject is "John and Jack")
- John and his mother *are* going to a movie.
- one of my teachers are *has* agreed to do this. (The subject is "one")
- The discovery of trade routes *is* .... (The discovery is the subject)
- The cost of mangoes has increased. (The cost is the subject)
- There *is* a list of items on the table. (The subject is list)
- Crime and punishment is a great novel. ("crime an punishment" is a book.
- Rajma and chawal *is* my favorite dish. (The subject is seen as a single thing, an unit so singular)
- Bread and butter *is* my favorite. 
- Pizza and burger *are* my favorite.
- Slow and steady wins the race. (Same as above, it should be seen as an unit)
- Few student *seem* to be interested in the program. 

- one fourth of men *are* stupid. (men is the subject.)
- 50% of the girls *are* ...

***Collective nouns are singular when they are used as a whole and plural if thier members are referred.***

- 1/4th of the workforce *is* unskilled. (workforce is a collective noun)
- The commitee *has* submitted its report. (commitee is a collective noun)
- Team India *has* won the match.
- Team India *has* done well. (Depends on the writer, it team as whole)
- Team India *have* done well. (Depends on the writer, it means members of the team)
- The staff *take* their seats in the meeting room. (collective noun but, each individual is taking their seats so plural verb is used.)


***Number are always singular. "The number" is singular and "A number" is plural***
- Twenty thousand dollars *is* a big amount. 
- A number of students *are* present.

***Proximity rule. The verb should agree to the subject near to it. e.g.***
1. Neither John nor Jack are rich -> Neither/or is a conjunction and the subject close to the verb is singular. 
2. Neither John nor his brothers **are** rich. -> Here we consider the proximity to the verb. "his brothers" is plural and thus the verb is plural. This is same for other forms of conjunctions below
	1. Either x or y.
	2. Neither x nor y.
	3. x or y.
3. Either of my father or my brothers *have* done this -> "my brothers is close to the verb".
4. My uncle or his children *are* ready to buy. -> "children is plural"
5. Either the newspaper or the magazines have been misplaced. "Magazines is plural"
6. My teacher or my friend *is* angry at me. 
- *Is* my boss or his adversaries going to win the case.
- *Are* my friends or he going to win the race.

***Exception to proximity rule : When there is a phrase like "as well as" used to combine two subjects the verb should agree with the formar subject e.g.***
- My father, as well as his friends *is* the responsible. ("as well as" -> it say in addition information for the subject.)
- My father and his friend *are* responsible. ("And" does the joining two subjects so "are")
- My friend with his wife *has* gone out. 
- My friend and his wife have gone out.
- The coach together with his player is going.

Other examples are 
	- as well as
	- in addition to
	- along with
	- together with

- The prime minister and his council of ministers *is* waiting for you. (exception to proximity rule.)
- Insomnia, as well as dehydration *is* the reason for her weakness. (exception to proximity rule.)
- The man along with his wife *has* returned. 
- A man with twenty wifes *is* bound to have immense wealth.


***Subject verb agreement exception : When there is an auxiliary verb present we should use plural. e.g.*** 
- she must *have* come.
- she ought to *have* come.
- should/would/could/might/ought etc. 
- The man along with his wife might *have* returned. 


***verb in dependent clause should agree with the actual subject. e.g.***

***Neither rule***

	1. Definite pronoun
		e.g. He, They, She, them etc.
	2. Indefinite pronoun :- *** All indefinite pronouns are singular. ***
		e.g. Someone, somebody, everyone, either, neither all are singular. Thus

***Some takes the form of the noun it qulifies.***
